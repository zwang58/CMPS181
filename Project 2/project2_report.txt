2. Meta-data
- Show your meta-data design (Tables and Columns table) and information about each column.


3. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that your team hasn't implemented this feature.
- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

Record format on page:
[number of fields][Null Indicators][column offset1][column offset2][column offset3] ->
[field data1][field data2][field data3]....
This format achieves O(1) access time because with the given record descriptor, the index of the requested field
can be calculated. Then the address of the field data can be calculated by header + index*(column offset length), 
therefore the data can be found at that address directly.

When storing a varchar field, the length of the varchar is extracted from the raw data first to determine the how many 
bytes to copy into the page. On page the varchar data is stored directly next to other fields without the preceding varchar
length. Instead the length is reflected in the difference between column offsets.

When updating a record, there are three cases to consider:
1. if the record size stays the same, just overwrite the old record at the same offset.
2. if the record size changes but can still fit on the same page, delete the old record first, then append the new record 
on the same page and record the new offset&length in the same slot directory so it can be access with the old RID.
3. if the record size expands and can't fit on the same page, delete it and insert it on another page with enough space.
Then store the returned RID in the old slot directory, but with a negative offset value to be distinguishable as a 
forwarding address.

To delete a record, the RBFM seeks the length and offset found in the slot directory determined by the given RID, and 
removes a block of that length at that offset. All the records behind the deleted record are moved forward by the deleted
length, so is the freespace offset. Depending on if the deleted record's slot directory used to be the last one on the page,
the slot is either removed (by decrementing number of slots in the header), or marked as reusable by giving it a length of 0.


4. Page Format
- Show your page format design.
- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

Each page begins with the Slot Header containing the freespace offset and the number of slot directories on this page.
All the slot directories, ordered by their slot number, follow the slot header. Each slot contains the length and offset 
of its record, or a disguised RID as a forwarding address.
Records are stored on the other side, between the freespace offset and end of page.

When updating a record, there are three cases to consider:
1. if the record size stays the same, just overwrite the old record at the same offset.
2. if the record size changes but can still fit on the same page, delete the old record first, then append the new record 
on the same page and record the new offset&length in the same slot directory so it can be access with the old RID.
3. if the record size expands and can't fit on the same page, delete it and insert it on another page with enough space.
Then store the returned RID in the old slot directory, but with a negative offset value to be distinguishable as a 
forwarding address.

the slot is either removed (by decrementing number of slots in the header), or marked as reusable by giving it a length of 0.
